      <center>JavaScript: the good parts notes</center>    
      You must learn to use JavaScript before you use It.<br>
      Java has a big broad range of skills.<br>
      JavaScript is succeeding V.S. java<br>
      JavaScript is loosely typed<br>
      Global variables allows for scripting attacks 
      With statements slows down the program for no reason.<br>
      Always use triple equal operator<br>
      Block less statements are bad<br>
      Code that is too tricky is often wrong.<br>
      Dynamic objects can have properties removed or added without making a new object.<br>
      Style is subjective<br>
      Bad style will equal bad results.<br>
